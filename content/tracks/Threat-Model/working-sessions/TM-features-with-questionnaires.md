description  : How to Threat Model Features with Questionnaires
---

## Why

Threat model need to be Agile oriented... Probably the nefarious alternative is not doing Threat Modeling at all. Ideally user stories in a sprint should trigger a basic Threat Model for the new feature.

## What

One of the approach to handle this is using Architecture-Pattern based analysis of the scope of this new features.
This analysis can be somehow linked to a set of questions that can help on identifiying common threats.

Open discussion: Is this enough? Can we identify better alternatives?â€‹ How would this be taken to a real case?


## Outcomes

This Working Session will publish a document (white paper) gathering the conclussions.
