## WHY

The CISO is responsible for the information security of an entire organization. He/She has to understand fully the enterprise vision and the strategies of the organization. And then take all the necessary steps to see the information assets and technologies properly protected.

## What

A CISO has a strong understanding of how to design, implement, maintain and enforce security.

He/she conducts risk assessment, mitigation and risk avoidance, look after the compliance side of the activities and last and not least the enterprise and security architecture.

A CISO maintains the procedures and policies within the business, plan actions to mitigate and recover from any security breaches.


## Outcomes

A CISO has probably earned a Bachelor degree in computer science and often has a Master degree in security. Some also have professional certification such as CISSP or CISM.

The previous experience of a CISO is hands on with incident response, security remediation in case of a breach, break-in or in some other kind of “hack attack.”
He or she has worked through multiple regulatory or legal compliance scenarios, including security audits and investigations.
