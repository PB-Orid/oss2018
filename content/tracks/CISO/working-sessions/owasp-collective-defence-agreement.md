## Why

In the same way that countries use [NATO Collective defence - Article 5](http://www.nato.int/cps/cn/natohq/topics_110496.htm)
 to:

 > create a unique and enduring principle that binds its members together, committing
 > them to protect each other and setting a spirit of solidarity within the Alliance
 (http://www.nato.int/cps/cn/natohq/topics_110496.htm)

companies should share information, knowledge, and resources so that malicious activities are easily detected and mitigated.

The framework created at the Working Session will promote collaboration between companies and create a shared mission to
protect customer data and company assets.

This Working Session aims to discuss and agree a first draft of 'AppSec Article 5'.

## What

 - Quickly review current similar efforts and learn from what worked and what didn't work (i.e. no need to re-invent the wheel)
 - Create a first definition of AppSec Article 5 (with rules of engagement)
 - Create a first list of companies that will sign the first version

## Outcomes

- Create one page document with the statement supported by FAQ
- Commitment to go to the boards for commitment
- Signed letter of intent (CISO's and Heads of)

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

 - CISOs
