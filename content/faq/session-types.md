### Working Sessions
**Working Sessions** focus on creating and evolving ideas, in order to create outcomes that will have an impact in the real world. They are a great way to join a group of practitioners to share expertise and knowledge on a particular subject.

### User Sessions
**User Sessions** are much more practical sessions, which will enable you to learn new skills or develop existing ones. They are also an opportunity to test out the outcomes of some of the Working Sessions. These are a presentation-free environment, driven by practitioners working with users.

### Product Sessions
**Product Sessions** are based around commercial products or services (i.e. not freely available)

These sessions are designed to provide an environment to share real-world insights about these products, to learn more about how to use them and to engage directly with the vendor.

Vendors are key players in the Security landscape and these sessions (all happening during the Evening) allow customers and potential customers to interact directly with the knowledgeable vendorâ€™s SMEs.
